# Prediabetes Prediction and Risk Factor Analysis

### Description of the Project
This project leverages logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression modeling techniques to identify whether there is a meaninful difference between the predictors (or risk factors) of prediabetes vs. diabetes. 

### Summary of the questions sought and the answers

__What are the strongest predictors of prediabetes and diabetes?__
The strongest predictors of prediabetes and diabetes are health related factors such as access to healthcare, overall health, and history or presence of common comorbid conditions like high blood pressure, BMI, heart attack, or stroke. 

While there were similarities between what were strong predictors of diabetes and prediabetes, there were some interesting differences, particularly when fitting a logistic regression model to predict classificaiton of prediabetes vs. diabetes. With this model, there were many of the same predictors that were strong predictors of prediabetes. However, one of the strongest predictors, no doctor because of cost, was not a strong predictor of diabetes vs. healthy, nor prediabetes vs. healthy, but was significant in predicting prediabetes relative to the diabetes. Not having a doctor due to cost decreased the likelihood of prediabetes
Diabetes:
BMI
Stroke
Physical Health
Heart Attack
High Blood Pressure

Prediabetes:
Physical Activity
No doctor because of cost
Mental Health
Heart attack
High Blood Pressure





__Are there meaningful differences between the predictors of prediabetes and diabetes, or are they similar?__


__Do these sets of predictors match existing screening standards?__
