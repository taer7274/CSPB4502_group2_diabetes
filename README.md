# Prediabetes Prediction and Risk Factor Analysis

### Team Members
Taylor Erickson 

### Description of the Project
This project leverages logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression modeling techniques to identify whether there is a meaninful difference between the predictors (or risk factors) of prediabetes vs. diabetes. 

### Summary of the questions sought and the answers

__What are the strongest predictors of prediabetes and diabetes?__


__Are there meaningful differences between the predictors of prediabetes and diabetes, or are they similar?__


__Do these sets of predictors match existing screening standards?__


### Application of this Knowledge

### Video Demo

### Final Project Paper
